# EcommerceAnalysisProject2
## The following project is an analysis of a fictitious e-commerce dataset on Google Big-Query. 
## A combination of pandas and SQL are used to create dataframes including information on tables in Big-Query through python code. 
## The first goal of this analysis is to evalute product sales and product web views. Then make a recommendation of cutting 20% of the products from the store.
## The second goal of this analysis is to examine user's data, as well as their purchase and return behavior. Then categorize users into meaningful segments and assign each user a category. 
## The results of the first goal can be used by the business to increase revenue and eliminate products that are not profitable for the company. This dataset does not include information about revenue generated from each product and would be useful in a product elimination recommendation. However, the combination of the number of sales and the number of web views should provide enough insight into products that are not profitable. 
## The results of the second goal can be used by the company for targeted advertising which should increase the revenue of the company. When a company is able to categorize users, they will be able to provide specific promotions geared toward specific customer groupings encouraging more purchases from the store.
